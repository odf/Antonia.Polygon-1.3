=== ABOUT ANTONIA POLYGON ===

Antonia is an original Poser figure by Olaf Delgado-Friedrichs
(Antonia.Polygon@gmail.com or odf at renderosity.com) with
contributions from phantom3D, MikeJ and others.

Antonia was created using Wings3D, Blender, Poser and DAZ Studio, as
well as a number of home-made software tools. As of October 2008, the
development of the figure has been documented and discussed in the
Poser forum at Renderosity (http://www.renderosity.com), and the
project owes a lot to the continuing feedback and support of the
Renderosity community. Still, Antonia is a pure hobby project and made
entirely for the fun of it, so do not expect a polished commerical
product.

The figure is provided free of charge and can be redistributed freely
as part of both commercial and non-commercial projects, see the license
statement below.

Please be aware that this is not true for the Toni Polygon texture by
SaintFox and Digitial-Lion that is included in some downloads for
Antonia Polygon 1.3. This texture may *not* be redistributed as part
of other products or freebies.

=== ABOUT THE TONI POLYGON TEXTURE ===

Toni Polygon is a photo-base texture made for Antonia by SaintFox and
Digital-Lion. Antonia 1.3 comes with default materials that use this
texture, so for the materials to work as intended, you need to install
it separately. For convenience, some downloads include the texture as
a ZIP file in the "Extra" folder.

Toni Polygon is not part of the Antonia release and does not fall under
the license summarized below. For more information about Toni Polygon,
see its separate readme file.

IMPORTANT: The Toni Polygon package contains its own material settings
in the Pose library under the folder "SF ToniPolygon". These were meant
for older Poser versions and are almost certainly not what you want,
especially when using SuperFly. Instead, use the settings provided in
the Materials library under odf/Antonia-1.3.


=== ABOUT THIS RELEASE (VERSION 1.3.0) ===

This is the third stable release of Antonia Polygon with some small
but significant modifications from the previous version 1.2.
Specifically, the eyes have been remodeled, the breast and hip
geometries modified, and the separate brows and toe caps removed.
The jaw, tongue and thigh joints have been modified and weight-mapped,
and the settings for the chest joint have also been changed.

Antonia 1.3 has some new and some improved expression morphs and new
hybrid FireFly/SuperFly materials based on the Toni Polygon texture
by SaintFox and Digital-Lion.

Not all content for previous versions of Antonia will work without
modifications. Textures, poses, hair fits and dynamic clothing should
generally be okay, but morphs will need to be transferred and adapted
to the new geometry. In many cases, Poser's "Copy Morphs From..."
features work quite nicely. Conforming clothing, especially tight
fitting items, will probably not work correctly without adjustments.

The development of the figure is ongoing, and Antonia 1.3 is meant as
a stepping stone for things to come. Future versions may well be
incompatible with the present one. If you are looking for something
more stable, Antonia may not be the right choice for you.
